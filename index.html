        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>	The purpose of this project is to create a scalable test flight application for drones. This application will be used to minimize the element of human risk and use fewer overall resources to test and report flight data in real-world conditions. 
            Real aerial routes will be provided, which will then be scaled to given boundaries, relocated to the test site, and then fed to our flight application. Mavic DJI 2 Enterprise Drones will fly the scaled and relocated route. While flying the given route, the drone will report flight data and status metrics to a UAV management UI to provide real-time flight data and drone status indicators. It will also provide options for commands and analysis that can be leveraged as part of a larger system.
